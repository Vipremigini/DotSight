# July 4th: Made the projector thing work in Blender!

This project is to make a camera with just a single photodetector. (Inspired by: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH6VUs5u8k). Before designing and building the actual thing, I want to figure out how the code actually works. So I have decided to implement it using Blender and Python. First thing to do: Make a projector like thiing in blender. Got the thing to work. Got it to display pictures and videos. Can project images stuff onto objects now. Next would be to make a light sensor thing in blender using Python.
